📌 A New Identity Framework for AI Agents  by Omar Santos — We are all experiencing the rapid proliferation of autonomous AI agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). These are no longer AI chatbots and assistants; they are increasingly self-directed entities capable of making decisions, performing actions, and interacting with critical systems at unprecedented scales. We need to perform fundamental re-evaluations of how identities are managed and access is controlled for these AI agents. https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-blogs/a-new-identity-framework-for-ai-agents/ba-p/5294337

## 📄 Reports

📘 Confidential AI Inference Systems — Anthropic and Pattern Labs are exploring confidential inference — an approach for running AI models on sensitive data without exposing it to infrastructure operators or cloud providers. In a typical AI deployment, three parties are involved: the model owner, the user providing the data, and the cloud provider hosting the service. Without safeguards, each must trust the others with sensitive assets. Confidential inference eliminates this need by enforcing cryptographic boundaries — ensuring that neither the data nor the model is accessible outside the secure enclave, not even to the infrastructure host. https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341501922383695872

📘 AI Red-Team Playbook for Security Leaders —  Hacken, Blockchain Security Auditor’s AI Red-Team Playbook for Security Leaders offers a strategic framework for safeguarding large language model (LLM) systems through lifecycle-based adversarial testing.
