📌 A New Identity Framework for AI Agents  by Omar Santos — We are all experiencing the rapid proliferation of autonomous AI agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). These are no longer AI chatbots and assistants; they are increasingly self-directed entities capable of making decisions, performing actions, and interacting with critical systems at unprecedented scales. We need to perform fundamental re-evaluations of how identities are managed and access is controlled for these AI agents. https://community.cisco.com/t5/security-blogs/a-new-identity-framework-for-ai-agents/ba-p/5294337

📌 How I used o3 to find CVE-2025–37899, a remote zeroday vulnerability in the Linux kernel’s SMB implementation by Sean Heelan. https://sean.heelan.io/2025/05/22/how-i-used-o3-to-find-cve-2025-37899-a-remote-zeroday-vulnerability-in-the-linux-kernels-smb-implementation/

## 📄 Reports

📘 Confidential AI Inference Systems — Anthropic and Pattern Labs are exploring confidential inference — an approach for running AI models on sensitive data without exposing it to infrastructure operators or cloud providers. In a typical AI deployment, three parties are involved: the model owner, the user providing the data, and the cloud provider hosting the service. Without safeguards, each must trust the others with sensitive assets. Confidential inference eliminates this need by enforcing cryptographic boundaries — ensuring that neither the data nor the model is accessible outside the secure enclave, not even to the infrastructure host. https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341501922383695872

📘 AI Red-Team Playbook for Security Leaders —  Hacken, Blockchain Security Auditor’s AI Red-Team Playbook for Security Leaders offers a strategic framework for safeguarding large language model (LLM) systems through lifecycle-based adversarial testing.

📖 Common Corpus: The Largest Collection of Ethical Data for LLM Pre-Training — Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language model pre-training.
