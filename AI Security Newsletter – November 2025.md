# 🔍 Insights

📌 [AI pentest scoping playbook](https://devansh.bearblog.dev/ai-pentest-scoping/)  
AI pentesting scoped as classic web testing misses most of the real attack surface. Include model, data, RAG, integrations, agents, and infrastructure; use OWASP LLM Top 10 only as baseline; answer concrete scoping questions; and run continuous adversarial testing instead of a single pre-production check. By Devansh Batham.

📌 [Hacking Gemini: A Multi-Layered Approach](https://buganizer.cc/hacking-gemini-a-mul ti-layered-approach-md)  
Multi-layer parsing in Gemini/Colab abused via markdown sanitizer quirks, linkification, and escaping to convert links into images; bypass CSP via open redirects; evade URI prefixing; and achieve indirect prompt injection that exfiltrates Google Workspace data (Gmail, Calendar, Drive) through Gemini extensions. By Valentino Massaro.
